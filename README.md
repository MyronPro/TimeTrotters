Description:

Time Trotters is a historical turn-based card game that is intended to distill how major events, movements, and policies are connected through simple gameplay mechanics. This initial iteration of Time Trotters serves as a prototype that showcases a foundational proof-of-concept that can be built upon through future iterations. 

How to Play:

A single match of Time Trotters occurs over five turns. The play space consists of a shifting timeline and the player’s hand of randomly generated cards, each containing either a description or image of a historical event. Over the course of the game, new year ticks will be added to the timeline. The player’s primary goal is to arrange the cards into a chronological order on the timeline. To achieve this, the player can perform two move types during their turn; they can move a previously played card into a different lane if they play the card is no longer chronologically accurate, and/or they can move a card from their hand into a lane of their choosing. Each lane can hold multiple cards and not every lane will have a card at the end of the final round. After the final round, the player will be presented with a score along with a display the shows which cards were placed correctly and incorrectly.
